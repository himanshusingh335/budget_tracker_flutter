Workflow:
	1.	Flutter Mobile App → Fetches budget & transaction data from Flask API.
	2.	Flask API → Reads/writes data in a SQLite database.
	3.	Mobile App → Sends analytical questions to CrewAI API.
	4.	CrewAI API → Processes data & returns insights.
	5.	Both APIs run in Docker containers on a Raspberry Pi, accessible anywhere via Tailscale VPN.
